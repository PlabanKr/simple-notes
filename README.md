### Overview

SimpleText++ is a simple desktop app for creating and saving `.txt` file.

### Running Developer Preview

#### Requirements

- [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/) should be installed in your system

If you have node installed then open the terminal in the project folder and follow the commands:

 1. Install all the dependencies with `npm install`
 2. Run `npm run devStart` and voila!

### Building Executable File

Using [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) you can build the app. Make sure you are in the project directory and run the command `npm run make`. Wait for couple of second and check the project directory. There will be an `out` folder containing binary executables.
